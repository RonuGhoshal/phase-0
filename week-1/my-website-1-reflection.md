Here is a link to my RonuGhoshal.github.io repo: https://github.com/RonuGhoshal/RonuGhoshal.github.io

To create a new repository (similar to a "folder") on GitHub, you can log into your account at www.github.com. Then, click the + sign in the upper right hand corner (next to your avatar). Click "new repository." Then, you can clone this (make a copy) from GitHub to your local computer. To clone a repository, enter the repository's URL into your web browser. Then, in the center of the screen, you should see some text next to where it says "HTTPS." Copy that <text>. Then, in your Terminal, make sure you are in your correct working directory, and enter "git clone <text>." This creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.

Open-source refers to the concept of making the code available for computer software. This code is published with different types of licenses, but open-source generally means the code is free for the public to view, edit, change, publish, and sometimes sell. As a new programmer, I am very excited about this concept - I think it's great to be able to explore, study, and mess around with others' code to try and understand what they did, and why. I do see how one would want to be careful with using open source code if they're trying to make profit from a program - however, at this stage in my programming career I think it'll be very beneficial.

Licensing is very important when publishing code - you can use licensing to state how much you want to "protect" the rights to your code. Depending on the type of license you select, others may be able to view, edit, publish, and even re-sell your code, so if you don't want them to publish or sell it, you'd definitely want to make sure you select the right type of license to legally protect your code from redistribution.

I enjoyed this challenge as it felt good to actually publish my own website - even if it only contained one sentence! I can't say I had any "a-ha moments," but I did find myself getting more comfortable using git commands. One thing I found myself struggling with was remembering to erase feature branches on my local machine after updating the master branch.

I found a few resources which I have found helpful while working with git:
