- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  I found it to be a bit tedious but overall rewarding. I'm pretty comfortable with a few basic tags (to create hyperlinks, include images, and put together the basic outline of a document) but had trouble remembering some of the other tags. Still, it wasn't hard to look up something if I wasn't sure how to do it.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  I am still getting a feel for the various types of HTML5 elements - I found it interesting that, for example, there are multiple ways to create italicized text - <em> for emphasis or <cite> for citations. I imagine this is practical in the long run, but as a beginner to HTML, it's something I hadn't thought about before.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  We tried to avoid styling and formatting the font using HTML. My pair had a bit more HTML experience than me, and suggested we use something called <hr> to create a horizontal line - I am not certain if this is considered good practice, or if it's something that woud ideally be done with CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

  Good: It seems relatively easy to learn, with no shortage of information on the subject or examples to refer to. Generally a quick Google search was able to answer my HTML questions. Also seems like it's probably a skill that's in high demand as it is so commonly used.

  Bad: It seems more tedious and less intellectually stimulating than Ruby or JavaScript programming. I also feel that it may be easy to get confused between older versions of HTML and the newer syntax, and it may be difficult to keep up with what are considered "best practices."

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Always remember to close your tags! I am also trying to get a better understanding of what the tags actually mean - I've seen "img src" and "a href" for years, but just today learned that the "src" means "source" and that the "a" means "anchor." I think understanding the meaning of tags will help me remember to write clean HTML.
