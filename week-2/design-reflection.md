**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

The 6 Phases of Web Design include 1) Information Gathering, 2) Planning, 3) Design, 4) Development, 5) Testing & Delivery, and 6) Maintenance.

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

My site's primary goal is to serve as a professional site - something I can show to potential employers to give them an idea of my skills, experience, and personality. I intend to feature links to my technical blog, projects I've worked on, and LinkedIn profile.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience would be potential employers or clients - they would be interested in seeing whether I'm skilled and qualified for their open positions. By presenting a well-designed, user-friendly site with strong content, I can demonstrate my professionalism and link them to projects that showcase my technical skills.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

This may depend on the user - if they're strictly interested in reviewing my tech skills, they may navigate straight to the "projects" section. If they're interested in learning more about my personality or writing style, they can review "About Me" or check out my blog. I'd also like them to be able to easily contact me without having to look around the site too much.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

One point that I found important was that web designers and UX designers are above all, *problem solvers*. Certainly they want their clients to be happy, but they also want to make sure that the *users* of the website are happy. Good, easy-to-use websites can make a huge difference - perhaps millions of dollars when dealing with large E-Commerce sites.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

User experience design refers to the process of increasing user satisfaction with a particular product, by making it more accessible and enjoyable to use. In this case, we've discussed it mostly in regards to websites, but it could in theory be relevant to any consumer product - from video games to stereo speakers.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

I found the reading at the beginning of the challenge to be a bit tedious - I was eager to get the reading done and start creating things!
