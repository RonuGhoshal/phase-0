A wireframe is a rough sketch of the layout for a website, providing a general idea of how things will be organized. This is beneficial because it enables you to plan how your user will process the informaton, before you move on to actually creating the website.

I can't say that I particularly enjoyed wireframing my site. I tried a few different online wireframing tools and found them all frustrating - many of their templates seemed complicated and I didn't know how to use the various widgets. Next time I think I will draw mine on a blank sheet of paper and then scan it.

The main question I asked myself is "How do I want my professional site to look? How do I want it to look when users navigate between my blog and my index page?" I consulted a few friends' professional websites to give myself some inspiration for my wireframe - here are their links:

I enjoyed thinking about how I wanted users to approach my site, and researching others' sites for ideas, but found the actual creation of the wireframe to be a bit tedious. I think this will be more enjoyable if I use tools that come more naturally to me (in this case, a pen and paper, or a more user-friendly drawing program).
